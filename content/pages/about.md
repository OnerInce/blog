This is the tech blog of [sradjoker](https://twitter.com/sradjoker) (Sravan Pannala).

Also has NBA analytics related stuff of [SravanNBA](https://twitter.com/SravanNBA)

I work on Lithium-Ion battery research during the day.

In my free time I like exploring linux/tech related stuff.

I'm a huge NBA fan, so I also like exploring NBA using stats and data visualization.

I also like playing with micro-controllers and SBCs like Raspberry Pi. 

I develop the [EndeavourOS](https://arm.endeavouros.com) ARM edition, for the Raspberry Pi and Odroid N2+.

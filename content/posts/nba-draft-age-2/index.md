This blog post is Part II of a series of draft analysis articles I'm writing. Main goal of this study is to analyze productivity of player drafted at different ages. 

Read Part II here:


## Results


## Sustained Production
- rolling average of 40 games
  
## Team performance

Playing time obviously affects opportunity to register a positive or a sustained trend of them. How does average minutes by age, draft rank, position vary over the years? %s that "make the rotation" (minimum standard at, what, 10+ avg minutes in 2/3rds of games? How many go 20+ minutes?)? 

Don't have to fully pursue all questions in a article or a part 1 article but good to at least identify other related matters.

Another split would be performance data of these groupings on good / bad current record teams or good / avg / bad. If we are studying drafting / results, it is very likely going to be affected by team context and advice to teams should recognize that. Maybe the advice varies by context, maybe it doesn't but it should be considered.

## Grouped by Position

## Average Pick Results
Finally lets visualize the same results as a function of Pick number rather than groups.

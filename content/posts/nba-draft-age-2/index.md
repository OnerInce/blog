This blog post is Part II of a series of draft analysis articles I'm writing. Main goal of this study is to analyze productivity of player drafted at different ages. 

Read Part II here:


## Results


## Sustained Production
- rolling average of 40 games
  
## Team performance

Playing time obviously affects opportunity to register a positive or a sustained trend of them. How does average minutes by age, draft rank, position vary over the years? %s that "make the rotation" (minimum standard at, what, 10+ avg minutes in 2/3rds of games? How many go 20+ minutes?)? 

Don't have to fully pursue all questions in a article or a part 1 article but good to at least identify other related matters.

Another split would be performance data of these groupings on good / bad current record teams or good / avg / bad. If we are studying drafting / results, it is very likely going to be affected by team context and advice to teams should recognize that. Maybe the advice varies by context, maybe it doesn't but it should be considered.

## Grouped by Position

## Average Pick Results
Finally lets visualize the same results as a function of Pick number rather than groups. 


## Notes (to be incorporated)

This tells me non-premium 1sts are very overvalued, and premium 2ndâ€™s are extremely undervalued

early into it but already learned about 20 year olds being most successful which adds up with my observation that the first sophomore picked in the draft is one of the safest picks a team can make

And that if you add the first sophomore taken that played on FIBA U19 as the oldest players in that tournament TONS of them hit. Haliburton being the best example but it's a recent development

This is the second blog post in a series of posts that will be documenting my Linux journey. It documents the first huge step I took when I installed Linux on actual hardware.

## Introduction
Let me go back to late November 2021. I had been using Linux for around 2 months now on WSL. I had a week of holidays coming up and I was thinking about ideas on how to spend them. I remembered that I had an old laptop lying around that I hadn't used since late 2017 (when I got my HP Spectre x360). At the time I replaced it, its hard drive was failing and the Windows 7 experience on it was already very sluggish. The laptop in question is Lenovo IdeaPad Z470 with Intel i5-2450M processor. I turned on the Laptop, and Windows 7 took a long time to boot. I then backed up some files I deemed necessary. Then I finally deemed my system ready for wiping Windows 7 and installing my "first" Linux distro (if you don't count WSL, which isn't a normal distro anyways).

## Finding a Distro
Now, I had to find a distro to install. So I did what I usually do when searching about new things, doing a web search first, reading through articles, news and blog posts. There a surprising number of articles (and YouTube videos) on the internet about top 5/10 Linux distributions for beginners. The distros most commonly recommended to beginners mostly include Ubuntu and Ubuntu based distros like Zorin OS, Feren OS, Elementary OS, Linux Mint and the such. This advice was appealing to me since I was coming from using Ubuntu 20.04 on WSL. I was familiar with using Ubuntu CLI commands to maintain and use the system (since WSL at that time was purely terminal based). So I figured the easiest way for me to use a Linux Desktop was to use something based on Ubuntu and after some more research I was left with a choice between Zorin OS and ElementaryOS (will be referred to as elOS in this blog) and ended up chosing elOS.


## Choosing ElementaryOS
So, why did I choose elOS. First, it was Ubuntu based. Second, it was recommended by many articles and videos saying it was very easy to use. Third, it looked really good on the screenshots. Finally, the most important reason was that the UI looks similar to macOS. I had never used macOS before and didn't want to buy a Mac. So using something that looks like it was the next best thing to do.

## Installing ElementaryOS
Because I was new to this, the first thing I looked at was a tool to burn the ISO on. I eventually settled on Balena Etcher since it was widely recommended.

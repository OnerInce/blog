## Introduction
Three point shooting is everywhere in the NBA currently. Teams are attempting and making more threes. Here is 3 Point attempts (3PA) per game (PG) every season for the last 10 seasons (including this one):

3PTA per game was around 22 in 2014-15 and increased every year till 2021-22 season. The 3PTA per game since has stabilized to a value between 34-35 per game. Meanwhile the accuracy of 3PT shots hasn't changed drastically over the years, fluctuating between 35 and 37%:

What I'm interesting in exploring is how important 3PT shooting is to winning games, which is the end goal.

## How often does a team win when it outscores its opponent from 3PT range:
First aspect I want to explore is the raw output, i.e. what if a team makes more 3's than its opponent. Here is how often do teams win in those situations:

<img src="./nba_3pt_winning_3.png" width="500" height="400">

We see that teams win anywhere between 64-68% when they make more 3s than their opponents. This translates to 52.5 to 56 wins in an 82 game season. The win percent has stabilized to around 66.9% over the past 3 seasons, equivalent to around 55 wins. 

So, we can conclude that making more 3 pointers than opponents plays a huge role in winning, and teams win around 2/3rd of their games in such situations.

## How often does a team win when it is more accurate than its opponent from 3PT range:
### Team 3PT % > Opponent 3PT %
Next, I want to explore how important is the accuracy i.e. the 3PT percentage, rather than makes, is to team winning.
Here is how often do teams win in those situations:

<img src="./nba_3pt_winning_4.png" width="500" height="400">

We see that teams win anywhere between 68-74% when they make more 3s than their opponents. This translates to 55 to 60.5 wins in an 82 game season. The win percent is around 70.5% over the past 2 seasons, equivalent to around 58 wins. 

Thus, we see that teams win at a slightly higher rate when they're more accurate from 3, compared to just making more 3s.  

### Team 3PT % > Opponent 3PT % + 5%
Now, what if team 3PT% is 5% higher than opponent 3PT%:

<img src="./nba_3pt_winning_5.png" width="500" height="400">

In this situation, teams win anywhere between 72% and 81%, which is a much higher percentage than the previous situations explored.
This is equivalent to 59-66.5 wins during an 82 game season. We observe an increasing trend in win% in this condition from 2014-2021, peaking at 80.8% during 2020-21 season. Then, there was a slight drop off to 79.8% during 2021-22 and 79.6% during 2022-23, before going through a sharp drop off to 72.8% for this season. Since, only a quarter of this season's game have been played as of today, there is a chance that this number might rise by the end of the season. I think we have to revisit and observe the trend at the end of the season.

So, removing this season, the teams are winning at around 80%, equivalent to 65.5 wins when teams 3PT% is 5% higher than opponent 3PT%. This condition shows a much higher correlation to winning than the previous conditions considered, which were closer to 55-58 wins. 

## Conclusion

Analyzing the 3PT trends over the past 10 seasons, we see that 3PT accuracy has a very high correlation to winning. Teams are winning 80% of their games when team 3PT% is 5% higher than opponent 3PT%, equivalent to 65.5 wins during an 82 game season. This number shows the importance of accurate 3PT shooting to winning in the NBA.

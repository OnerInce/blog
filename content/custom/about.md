This is the tech blog of [sradjoker](https://twitter.com/sradjoker) (Sravan Pannala).

I work on Lithium-Ion battery research during the day.

In my free time I like exploring linux/tech related stuff. 

I also like playing with microcontrollers and SBCs like Raspberry Pi. 

I develop the [EndeavourOS](https://arm.endeavouros.com) ARM edition, for the Raspberry Pi and Odroid N2+.
